/* I tried using an approach to be able to make callbacks into bound methods, but it sucked a lot
 * because i still need to store the "this" pointer at some structure (subscriber) and also to be able to
 * call a bounded method i need it to belong to a certain class (really c++Â¿) so basically i needed an extra
 * class just to be able to do (class->*cb)( ) which sucked like a black hole (seriously whats with that syntax!)
 * it also prevented me to create callbacks to static methods..
 * so i rather just do Board* diz = (Board*) sender; and fuck the world
 * also it went against the K.I.S.S. principle.
